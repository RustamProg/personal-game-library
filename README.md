# personal-game-library
First MVVM project. It's a simple game library project.
I divided View - ViewModel - Model to different namespaces (folders). It's recommended to make model as a new project, I know it

Here you can see main application panel with programs

This is almost the same to prevoius screenshot, but here you can see only favourite apps

Here you can see settings menu. For now it's can be used only to save apps list to JSON file

It's a ready JSON file example
